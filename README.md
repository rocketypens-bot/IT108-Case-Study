📚 Project Documentation:
This project combines two distinct, client-side web applications using standard HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. All data for both applications is stored in the browser's localStorage.

1. ⚙️ Part 1: User Management Flow
This flow handles account creation, profile completion, and sign-in, maintaining a consistent user record across pages.

2. 🗓️ Part 2: Event Management System (CRUD App)
This is a separate application for managing event records (Create, Read, Update, Delete). It acts as a simple, front-end database interface.

🚀 Getting Started
Clone or Download the project files.

Open signup.html to begin the user registration flow, or open eventms.html to start managing event data.

⚠️ Important Note on Security
All data in this project, including passwords, is stored in plain text within the browser's localStorage. This setup is for educational and demonstration purposes only.

NEVER use localStorage to store sensitive data in a production application. Real-world applications require server-side storage and strong password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
