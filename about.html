        <p>
            The Information Technology Society (ITS), as the official student organization representing the IT Department, faces major challenges in organizing, managing, and tracking numerous event-related requests. With a population of more than 600 IT students from 1st year to 4th year, the number of technical requests and event proposals has significantly increased.
        </p>
        <p>
            This large volume of requests often leads to confusion, inaccurate submissions, and overlooked entries. Some items or equipment needed for events are unavailable, while others are wrongly listed due to miscommunication between requesters and ITS officers. As a result, event preparation becomes disorganized, and coordination with suppliers and other departments is often delayed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Without a proper digital system, ITS struggles to keep accurate records of events, equipment requests, schedules, and responsibilities making it difficult to maintain smooth operations and accountability.
